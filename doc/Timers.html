			<p>The AVR has different Timer types. Not all AVRs have all Timers, 
so look at the datasheet of your AVR before trying to use a timer it 
doesn't have...This description is based on the AT90S2313.</p>
			<p>I will only describe the "simple" timer modes all timers have. 
Some AVRs have special timers which support many more modes than the 
ones described here, but they are also a bit more difficult to handle, 
and as this is a beginners' site, I will not explain them here.</p>
			<p>The timers basically only count clock cycles. The timer clock can 
be equal to the system clock (from the crystal or whatever clocking 
option is used) or it can be slowed down by the prescaler first. When 
using the prescaler you can achieve greater timer values, while 
precision goes down.</p>
			<p>The prescaler can be set to 8, 64, 256 or 1024 compared to the 
system clock. An AVR at 8 MHz and a timer prescaler can count (when 
using a 16-bit timer) (0xFFFF + 1) * 1024 clock cycles = 67108864 clock 
cycles which is 8.388608 seconds. As the prescaler increments the timer 
every 1024 clock cycles, the resolution is 1024 clock cycles as well: 
1024 clock cycles = 0.000128 seconds compared to 0.125µs resolution and a
 range of 0.008192 seconds without prescaler. It's also possible to use 
an external pin for the timer clock or stop the timer via the prescaler.</p>
			<p>The timers are realized as up-counters. Here's a diagram of the 
basic timer hardware. Don't panic, I'll explain the registers below.</p>

				The 8-bit Timer:<a name="8bit_timer"></a></div>
			<img class="image" src="Timers_files/timer8.gif" alt="" border="0" height="318" width="661">
			<p>The 8-bit timer is pretty simple: The timer clock (from System 
Clock, prescaled System Clock or External Pin T0) counts up the 
Timer/Counter Register (TCNT0). When it rolls over (0xFF -&gt; 0x00) the
 Overflow Flag is set and the Timer/Counter 1 Overflow Interrupt Flag is
 set. If the corresponding bit in TIMSK (Timer Interrupt Mask Register) 
is set (in this case the bit is named "TOIE0") and global Interrupts are
 enabled, the micro will jump to the corresponding interrupt vector (in 
the 2313 this is vector number 7).</p>
			<div class="heading_small">
				<nobr>The 16-bit Timer<a name="16bit_timer"></a></nobr></div>
			is a little more complex, as it has more modes of operation:<br>

			<p>The register names vary from timer to timer and from AVR to AVR! Have a look at the datasheet of the AVR you're using first.</p>
			<p>Important note: All 16-bit registers have can only be accessed one
 byte at a time. To ensure precise timing, a 16-bit temporary register 
is used when accessing the timer registers.</p>
			<p>Write:<br>
				When writing the high byte (e.g. TCNT1H), the data is placed in the 
TEMP register. When the low byte is written, the data is transferred to 
the actual registers simultaneously. So the high byte must be written 
first to perform a true 16-bit write.</p>
			<p>Read:<br>
				When reading the low byte, the high byte is read from TCNT1 
simultaneously and can be read afterwards. So when reading, access the 
low byte first for a true 16-bit read.</p>
			<div class="heading_small">
				TCNT<a name="tcnt"></a></div>
			<p>Most important is the Timer/Counter Register (TCNT1) itself. This 
is what all timer modes base on. It counts System Clock ticks, prescaled
 system clock or from the external pin.</p>

				TCCR</div>
			<p>The Timer/Counter Control register is used to set the timer mode, prescaler and other options.</p>

			<p>The Output Compare register can be used to generate an Interrupt 
after the number of clock ticks written to it. It is permanently 
compared to TCNT1. When both match, the compare match interrupt is 
triggered. If the time between interrupts is supposed to be equal every

 It holds the Timer Interrupt Flags corresponding to their enable bits 
in TIMSK. If an Interrupt is not enabled your code can check TIFR to 
deternime whether an interrupt has occured and clear the interrupt 
flags. Clearing the interrupt flags is usually done by writing a logical
 1 to them (see datasheet).</p>

			<div class="heading_small">
				Normal Mode:</div>
			<p>In normal mode, TCNT1 counts up and triggers the Timer/Counter 1 
Overflow interrupt when it rolls over from 0xFFFF to 0x0000. Quite 
often, beginners assume that they can just load the desired number of 
clock ticks into TCNT1 and wait for the interrupt (that's what I 
did...). This would be true if the timer counted downwards, but as it 
counts upwards, you have to load 0x0000 - (timer value) into TCNT1. 
Assuming a system clock of 8 MHz and a desired timer of 1 second, you 
need 8 Million System clock cycles. As this is too big for the 16-bit 
range of the timer, set the prescaler to 1024 (256 is possible as well).</p>
			<p>8,000,000/1024 = 7812.5 ~ 7813<br>
				0x0000 - 7813 = 57723 &lt;- Value for TCNT1 which will result in an 
overflow after 1 second (1.000064 seconds as we rounded up before)</p>
			<p>So we now know the value we have to write to the TCNT1 register. 
So? What else? This is not enough to trigger the interrupt after one 
second. We also have to enable the corresponding interrupt and the 
global interrupt enable bit. Here's a flow chart of what happens:</p>
			<img class="image" src="Timers_files/timer_ovf_int.gif" alt="" border="0" height="444" width="432">
			<p>The only steps you have to do are:</p>
			<p>- set prescaler to 1024 (set bits CS12 and CS10 in TCCR1B)<br>
				- write 57723 to TCNT1<br>
				- enable TOIE1 in TIMSK<br>
				- enable global interrupt bit in SREG<br>
				- wait. Or do anything else. All the counting and checking flags is done in hardware.</p>
			<div class="heading_small">
				Output Compare Mode<a name="output_compare_mode"></a></div>
			<p>The Output Compare mode is used to perform repeated timing. The 
value in TCNT1 (which is counting up if not stopped by the prescaler 
select bits) is permanently compared to the value in OCR1A. When these 
values are equal to each other, the Output Compare Interrupt Flag (OCF 
in TIFR) is set and an ISR can be called. By setting the CTC1 bit in 
TCCR1B, the timer can be automatically cleared upon compare match.</p>
			<p><img class="image" src="Timers_files/timer_comp.gif" alt="" border="0"></p>
			<p>The flow chart should show an arrow from CTC1 set? "Yes" to set 
OCF instead of a line, but somehow the Flow Charting Program didn't 
think that was a good idea. Bad luck.</p>
			<p>Let's discuss a small example:We want the Timer to fire an int 
every 10ms. At 8 MHz that's 80,000 clock cycles, so we need a prescaler 
(out of 16-bit range).</p>
			<p>In this case, 8 is enough. Don't use more, as that would just pull
 down accuracy. With a prescaler of 8, we need to count up to 10,000.As 
the value of TCNT1 is permanently compared to OCR1 and TCNT1 is 
up-counting, the value we need to write to OCR is acutally 10,000 and 
not 0x0000-10,000, as it would be when using the timer in normal mode.</p>
			<p>Also, we need to set CTC1: If we didn't, the timer would keep on 
counting after reaching 10,000, roll over and then fire the next int 
when reaching 10,000, which would then occur after 0xFFFF*8 clock 
cycles. That's after 0.065536 seconds. Not after 10ms. If CTC1 is set, 
TCNT1 is cleared after compare match, so it will count from 0 to 10,000 
again with out rolling over first.</p>
			<p>What is to be done when those 10ms Interrupts occur? That depends 
on the application. If code is to be executed, the corresponding 
interrupt enable bit has to be set, in this case it is OCIE1A in TIMSK. 
Also check that global interrupts are enabled.</p>
			<p>If the OC1 (Output Compare 1) pin is to be used, specify the mode 
in TCCR1A. You can set, clear or toggle the pin. If you decide that you 
want to toggle it, think about your timing twice: If you want a normal 
pulse which occurs every 10ms, the timer cycle must be 5ms: 5ms -&gt; 
toggle on -&gt; 5ms -&gt; toggle off. With the 10ms example above and 
OC1 set up to be toggled, the pulse would have a cycle time of 20ms.</p>
			<div class="heading_small">
				Input Capture Mode<a name="input_capture_mode"></a></div>
			<p>The Input Capture Mode can be used to measure the time between two
 edges on the ICP pin (Input Capture Pin). Some external circuits make 
pulses which can be used in just that way. Or you can measure the rpm of
 a motor with it. You can either set it up to measure time between 
rising or falling edges on the pin. So if you change this setting within
 the ISR you can measure the length of a pulse. Combine these two 
methods and you have completely analysed a pulse. How it works?</p>
			<p>Here's a flow chart of its basic functionality:</p>
			<img class="image" src="Timers_files/timer_capt.gif" alt="" height="302" width="525">
			<p>You see that it's actually pretty simple. I left out the low level
 stuff such as Interrupt validation (enabled/global enable), as you 
should understand that by now. The contents of TCNT1 are transferred to 
ICR1 when the selected edge occurs on the Input Capture Pin and an ISR 
can be called in order to clear TCNT1 or set it to a specific value. The
 ISR can also change the egde which is used to generate the next 
interrupt.</p>
			<p>You can measure the length of a pulse if you change the edge select bit from within the ISR. This can be done the following way:</p>
			<p>Set the ICES (Input Capture Edge Select) bit to 1 (detect rising edge)</p>
			<p>When the ISR occurs, set TCNT1 to zero and set ICES to 1 to detect negative egde</p>
			<p>When the next ISR is called, the pin changed from high to low. The
 ICR1 now contains the number of (prescaled) cycles the pin was high. If
 the ISR again sets the edge to be detected to rising (ICES=1), the low 
pulse time is measured. Now we have the high time AND the low time: We 
can calculate the total cycle time and the duty cycle.</p>
			<p>It's also possible to connect the Analog Comparator to the input 
capture trigger line. That means that you can use the Analog Comparator 
output to measure analog signal frequencys or other data sources which 
need an analog comparator for timing analysis. See the <a href="http://www.avrbeginners.net/architecture/ana_comp.html">Analog Comparator page</a> for more.</p>
			<div class="heading_small">
				PWM Mode<a name="pwm_mode"></a></div>
			<p>The Pulse Width Modulator (PWM) Mode of the 16-bit timer is the 
most complex one of the timer modes available. That's why it's down 
here.</p>
			<p>The PWM can be set up to have a resolution of either 8, 9 or 10 
bits. The resolution has a direct effect on the PWM frequency (The time 
between two PWM cycles) and is selected via the PWM11 and PWM10 bits in <a href="#tccra">TCCR1A</a>.
 Here's a table showing how the resolution select bits act. Right now 
the TOP value might disturb you but you'll see what it's there for. The 
PWM frequency show the PWM frequency in relation to the timer clock 
(which can be prescaled) and NOT the system clock.</p>

			<p>To understand the next possible PWM settings, I should explain how
 the PWM mode works. The PWM is an enhanced Output Compare Mode. In this
 mode, the timer can also count down, as opposed to the other modes 
which only use an up-counting timer. In PWM mode, the timer counts up 
until it reaches the TOP value (which is also the resolution of the 
timer and has effect on the frequency).</p>
			<p>When the TCNT1 contents are equal to the OCR1 value, the 
corresponding output pin is set or cleared, depending on the selected 
PWM mode: You can select a normal and an inverted PWM. This is selected 
with the COM1A1 and COM1A0 bits (TCCR1A register). The possible settings
 are:</p>
			<table class="content" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="1" width="246">
				<tbody><tr>
					<td>COM1A1</td>
					<td>COM1A0</td>
					<td>Effect:</td>

				<tr>
					<td>0</td>
					<td>0</td>
					<td>PWM disabled</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>0</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>PWM disabled</td>

					<td>0</td>
					<td>Non-inverting PWM</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>inverting PWM</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<p>Non-inverted PWM means that the Output Compare Pin is CLEARED when
 the timer is up-counting and reaches the OCR1 value. When the timer 
reaches the TOP value, it switches to down-counting and the Output 
Compare Pin is SET when the timer value matches the OCR1 value.</p>
			<p>Inverted PWM is, of course, the opposite: The Output Compare Pin 
is set upon an up-counting match and cleared when the down-couting timer
 matches the OCR1 value. Here are two diagrams showing what this looks 
like:</p>
			<img class="image" src="Timers_files/timer_pwm.gif" alt="" height="394" width="525">
			<p>The reason why you can select between inverting and non-inverting 
pwm is that some external hardware might need an active-low pwm signal. 
Having the option to invert the PWM signal in hardware saves code space 
and processing time.</p>
			<p>The PWM is also glitch-free. A glitch can occur when the OCR1 
value is changed: Imagine the PWM counting down to 0. After the pin was 
set, the OCR1 value is changed to some other value. The next pulse has 
an undefined length because only the second half of the pulse had the 
specified new length. That's why the PWM automatically writes the new 
value of OCR1 upon reaching the TOP value and therefore prevents 
glitches.</p>

			<p>Typical applications for the PWM are motor speed controlling, 
driving LEDs at variable brightness and so on. Make sure you have 
appropriate drivers and protection circuitry if you're using motors!</p>
